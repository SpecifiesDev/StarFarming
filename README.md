# FAQ

### Why did you discontinue the project?
For months I've been getting questions about why I stopped development of this project. I never intended to "discontinue" it. A month after releasing the snapshot I moved 8 states away and had to handle a lot of life things in those regards. I fully intend to develop this project as an independent gamemode.

### How will updates work?
Each update will correspond to the latest version of Spigot. So, if 1.19.4 is the latest, that will be the version the update is pushed in. I will not ensure backwards compatability, as I fully intend the resources that newer versions of mc offers.

### Can we buy your resource?
I've gotten this question a lot. This resource is popular inside of Chinese MC servers, and I've had quite a few people contact me asking to buy rights to the source. No, I will not be selling the rights to this resource. Obviously I'm open sourcing it, but usage of it will be in accordance to the license I'm sourcing it under. I also do not permit use of my code for monetary gain. Meaning, you can't use the codebase for yourself, and sell a repackaged version of my resource on a marketplace.

### I want to become a dev of the project
When I first started this project, I actually had accepted a dev onto my team. I actually really don't want to do that, as I don't want to take away from my own ideas and vision of the project.
